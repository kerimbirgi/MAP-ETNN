"""
Protein pocket lifter for PDBBind dataset - extracts higher-order structural features 
from protein binding pockets that are analogous to ligand rings.

Features extracted:
1. Hydrophobic patches - clusters of nonpolar residues
2. Polar clusters - groups of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors  
3. Aromatic clusters - stacked aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp)
4. Charged clusters - groups of positively/negatively charged residues
